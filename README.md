# Web Notes
A place for storing notes.

## About
This project was more about creating a more polished product than doing something unique.
I tried making a "notes app" from scratch to see how hard it would be to build one with no libraries, and quickly learned why most companies use third party software instead of their own.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
