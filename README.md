# Web Notes
A place for storing notes.

## About
This project was more about creating a more polished product than doing something unique.
I tried making a "notes app" from scratch to see how hard it would be to build one with no libraries, and quickly learned why most companies use third party software instead of their own(
selection-handling, clipboard formatting and implementation for pasted text and images/videos, being able to resize, redraw, and re-render a canvas element without it stretching the drawings themselves, etc.)

## Personal Standing on Project
 Local storage currently to persist data (option to download files are available)  
 UI still needs work, it's not bad but still feels kinda hacked together in certain parts

## Future addons/ improvements
- A drawing canvas. This one's mostly complete, just want to add more options for the canvas is all.
- Possibly making a code editor mode with a live preview function. this addon is basically a project in itself but I do wanna add this feature.
- More themes or the option to create custom themes with a live preview example to see how your color values appear.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
